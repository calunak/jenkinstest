This is a test to see whether I can automatically compile, test and build a simple qt project using jenkins on a centOS machine.
The simple-qt-gui.pro file will be modified by a 'developer', after which he will upload his revised version of the code on github.
Jenkins will automatically at a given time run 'Jenkinsfile' which is a pipeline consisting of instructions on what to do.
We will simply build the project in order to generate an exe.
